# Operating Systems Assignments

This repository contains all the assignments I have completed for the **Operating Systems** course. Below is a brief overview of each assignment. You can find more details in the corresponding PDF files and the code in each directory.

## 1. Shell Implementation
- **Objective**: Build a custom shell that supports various commands, including multi-pipeline commands, background execution, and more.
- **Assignment Details**: [PDF: Shell Implementation Assignment Requirements](https://github.com/hsylin/Operating-Systems/blob/main/HW1/2022_OS_HW1.pdf)
- **Code and Documentation**: The complete implementation and related files are available in the `HW1` directory.

## 2. Matrix Multiplication with pthread
- **Objective**: Use `pthread` to perform matrix multiplication on large matrices (4096x4096) and write the results to a proc file.
- **Assignment Details**: [PDF: Matrix Multiplication Assignment Requirements](https://github.com/hsylin/Operating-Systems/blob/main/HW2/2022_OS_HW2.pdf)
- **Code and Documentation**: The complete implementation and related files are available in the `HW2` directory.

## 3. Scheduling Algorithm Simulation
- **Objective**: Write and simulate different scheduling algorithms, including Round Robin, First Come First Serve (FCFS), and Priority-Based Preemptive Scheduling. Use `ucontext` to create and manage tasks in user space.
- **Assignment Details**: [PDF: Scheduling Algorithm Assignment Requirements](https://github.com/hsylin/Operating-Systems/blob/main/HW3/2022_OS_HW3.pdf)
- **Code and Documentation**: The complete implementation and related files are available in the `HW3` directory.
