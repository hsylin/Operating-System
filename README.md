# Operating Systems Assignments

This repository contains all the assignments I have completed for the **Operating Systems** course. Below is a brief overview of each assignment. You can find more details in the corresponding PDF files and the code in each directory.

## 1. Shell Implementation
- **Objective**: Designed and implemented a custom shell supporting multi-pipeline commands, background execution, and advanced command handling, including input/ output redirection and process control.
- **Assignment Details**: [PDF: Shell Implementation Assignment Requirements](https://github.com/hsylin/Operating-Systems/blob/main/HW1/2022_OS_HW1.pdf)
- **Code and Documentation**: The complete implementation and related files are available in the `HW1` directory.

## 2. Matrix Multiplication with pthread
- **Objective**: Developed and optimized a high-performance multi-threaded matrix multiplication algorithm for large datasets (4096x4096), leveraging a custom Linux kernel module to record thread execution times and context switches via proc file interactions.
- **Assignment Details**: [PDF: Matrix Multiplication Assignment Requirements](https://github.com/hsylin/Operating-Systems/blob/main/HW2/2022_OS_HW2.pdf)
- **Code and Documentation**: The complete implementation and related files are available in the `HW2` directory.

## 3. Scheduling Algorithm Simulation
- **Objective**: Developed a user-level thread scheduler simulator implementing multiple scheduling algorithms (FCFS, RR, and priority-based preemptive), along with resource management and signal handling using ucontext APIs in C.
- **Assignment Details**: [PDF: Scheduling Algorithm Assignment Requirements](https://github.com/hsylin/Operating-Systems/blob/main/HW3/2022_OS_HW3.pdf)
- **Code and Documentation**: The complete implementation and related files are available in the `HW3` directory.
