# Operating Systems Assignments

This repository contains all the assignments I have completed for the Operating Systems course. Below is a brief overview of each assignment, with additional details available in the accompanying PDF files, as well as the code in each directory.

1. **Shell Implementation**: In this assignment, I built a simple shell that supports various commands, including multi-pipeline commands, background execution, and more.

2. **Matrix Multiplication with pthread**: This task involves using pthread to perform matrix multiplication on large matrices (4096x4096) and writing the results to a proc file.

3. **Scheduling Algorithm Simulation**: The final assignment required writing and simulating different scheduling algorithms, including Round Robin, First Come First Serve (FCFS), and Priority-Based Preemptive Scheduling. We utilized `ucontext` to create tasks, allowing scheduling and management of tasks in user space.

I have implemented extensive functionality beyond the basic requirements for each assignment, and I encourage you to explore the code and documentation for a comprehensive understanding of my work.
